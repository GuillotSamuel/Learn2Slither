Generate a clear and concise Python docstring for the following function.
The docstring should include:
1. A short description of the function's purpose.
2. A more detailed explanation of how the function works.
3. A description of each parameter (with type) under an "Args:" section.
4. The return value (with type) under a "Returns:" section.
5. If a comment is already in the function pasted, ignore it and create your own comment.
6. Only return the new comment generated, DO NOT RETURN THE FULL FUNCTION OR ANY OTHER TEXT/EXPLICATION
7. If I paste other functions after this message, do the same for them.
8. I will probably sometimes put more than one function at the same time, generate as many comments as functions in the message.
9. The comments needs to respect the FLAKE8 norm so limit the size of the lines.
10. An example usage under an "Example:" section.

Follow PEP 257 and Google-style docstring conventions.

Here is the function:

Example format to follow:

"""
Moves the snake in the specified direction and updates its position.

This function updates the snake's head position based on the given direction
("UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT"). It inserts the new head at the beginning of
the snake body list and removes the last element to maintain the same length.

Args:
    direction (str): The direction to move the snake. Must be one of
        "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", or "RIGHT".
    snake_body (list[tuple[int, int]]): A list of (x, y) coordinates
        representing the snake's body segments, where the first element
        is the head.

Returns:
    list[tuple[int, int]]: The updated list of snake body coordinates after
    moving in the specified direction.

Example:
    >>> snake = [(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3)]
    >>> move_snake("UP", snake)
    [(5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 4)]
