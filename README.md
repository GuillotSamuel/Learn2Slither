## 🎯 About the Project

Learn2Slither is an advanced implementation of the classic Snake game using reinforcement learning with Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks. The project enables training an AI capable of playing Snake autonomously and achieving impressive performance.

The agent learns to navigate the environment, avoid obstacles, collect food, and maximize its length through a sophisticated reward system and an optimized neural network architecture.

## 🔬 Technical Solution

### Training Methods

Learn2Slither implements **two distinct reinforcement learning approaches**:

#### 1. Traditional Q-Learning
- **Table-based approach**: Direct state-action value mapping
- **Memory efficient**: Compact Q-table storage
- **Fast inference**: Direct lookup for action selection
- **Best for**: Stable, interpretable learning

#### 2. Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with 4 fully-connected layers
- **Input**: 16-dimensional vector representing the game state
- **Output**: 3 possible actions (turn left, go straight, turn right)
- **Architecture**:
  - Input layer: 16 → 256 neurons
  - Hidden layer 1: 256 → 128 neurons
  - Hidden layer 2: 128 → 64 neurons
  - Output layer: 64 → 3 neurons
  - Activation: ReLU
  - Dropout: 10% to prevent overfitting

### State Representation

The game state is encoded in a **16-dimensional vector**:
- **Raycast vision**: 4 cardinal directions (front, left, right, back)
- **Multi-target detection**: Walls (W), Snake body (S), Apple (A), Empty (R)
- **Normalized distances**: 0.0 to 1.0 based on maximum detection range
- **Current direction awareness**: Relative to snake's heading

### Learning Algorithms

#### Q-Learning Parameters
- **Exploration vs Exploitation**: ε-greedy strategy with adaptive decay
- **Learning rate**: 0.1 (traditional Q-Learning)
- **Discount factor**: γ = 0.99
- **Epsilon decay**: Adaptive based on training progress

#### Deep Q-Learning Parameters
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate of 0.001
- **Loss function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Target network**: Updated periodically for stability
- **Experience replay**: Batch learning from stored experiences

### Reward System

- **Positive reward**: +10 for collecting an apple
- **Negative reward**: -10 for collision (death)
- **Survival reward**: +1 for each step without collision
- **"Ultra Rewards" mode**: enriched reward system based on food proximity
